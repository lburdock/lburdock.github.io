A mismatch between server and client-side HTML in our Next.js app caused a cascading styling error that took me 2 weeks to debug.

<!--truncate-->

## The problem

We received a report that the styles were broken on some pages, but the bug couldn't be consistently reproduced.

After doing some digging, these were my observations:

- The styles weren't missing or wrong, they were just incorrectly applied to elements further down the page
- The server-side html was styled correctly (verified by disabling JS and refreshing the page)
- The styling errors only happened on client side rehydration
  - You had to refresh a page to see the styling error
  - The styling error didn't occur if you navigated to the page through the app (since that client-side rendered the page)
- The bug happened in production on statically generated pages, but couldn't be reproduced during normal local development (because this was just client side rendering the page)
  - To reproduce it locally, the app had to be built and served

### An example

Below is an example Next.js page that reproduces this error. The highlighted code forces a mismatch between the server and the client by only displaying `data` on server side render.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JS', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'CSS', value: 'css', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="js">

```jsx {13}
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      data: "Hello from the server!",
    },
  };
}

export default function Home({ data }) {
  const isServer = typeof window === "undefined";
  return (
    <>
      {isServer && <div className="blue">{data}</div>}
      <div className="red">Red text - css</div>
      <div style={{ color: "green" }}>Green text - style prop</div>
      <div data-emoji="ðŸ”¥">Black text - emoji should appear here</div>
      <div>Black text - no attributes</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="css">

```css
.blue {
  color: blue;
}

.red {
  color: red;
}

div[data-emoji]::after {
  content: " " attr(data-emoji);
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

_You can see that the server/client mismatch caused the attributes to be added to the wrong elements._

## The answer

As it turns out, this is expected behavior when you rehydrate your HTML using [`ReactDOM.hydrate`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate):

> React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client. It can patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. **There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches.**

There you have it! When the server and client HTML don't match, attributes may not be on the correct element.

## The solution (part 1)

**As the React docs state, we need to fix any server and client HTML mismatches!**

That sounds easy enough, but the code in our app wasn't purposefully causing a mismatch like the example code that checks for the `window`.

## The problem (part 2)
